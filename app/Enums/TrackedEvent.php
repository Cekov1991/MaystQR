/**
 * The things we count.
 *
 * This exists because the funnel from "stranger lands on the homepage" to
 * "subscription row" was entirely invisible. Every step of it already happened
 * in code we own; none of it was ever written down, so questions as basic as
 * "how many people generate a code and then look at the price" had no answer.
 *
 * Two rules govern the whole design, and they are the reason this is an
 * anonymous counter rather than analytics:
 *
 * 1. A row never identifies anyone. No user id, no session id, no IP, no user
 *    agent — enforced by EventPrivacyTest, not by good intentions. Section 2 of
 *    the Privacy Policy says we build no profile of the pages you visit, and a
 *    single identifier column would make that false. Where per-person
 *    attribution is genuinely needed it lives on the user's own row as
 *    `users.signup_source`, which is one durable fact about their account
 *    rather than a stream of their behaviour.
 *
 * 2. Context stays low-cardinality. A handful of known labels, never a URL and
 *    never anything a visitor typed. The moment this holds free text it has
 *    become a request log with a query planner attached.
 *
 * Page views are deliberately absent. They are the highest-volume row by far,
 * the only candidate with no action behind them, and precisely what the Privacy
 * Policy disclaims. We count things people did, not places they were.
