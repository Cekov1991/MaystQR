/**
 * What a browser is allowed to say happened.
 *
 * This is the narrow gate in front of the only writable-by-strangers path into
 * `site_events`, and it is deliberately narrower than the table. Three rules
 * shape it:
 *
 * 1. Only the events that genuinely cannot be seen from the server. Everything
 *    else — the generations, the checkouts — is recorded on a path we control,
 *    and TrackedEvent::isClientLoggable() is the list. Accepting more than that
 *    would let anyone POST `checkout_completed` in a loop and quietly ruin the
 *    only record we have of revenue, undetectably, because there is no
 *    identifier on these rows to spot a flood with.
 *
 * 2. The request names the event; it never composes the row. `context` is not a
 *    field here. The caller may send one allowlisted extra fact (`format`) and
 *    the request assembles the context itself, so there is no path at all for a
 *    URL, or anything else a visitor typed, to arrive in that column. This is
 *    the same promise the homepage makes about the code itself, applied to the
 *    count written alongside it.
 *
 * 3. Nothing about the sender is read. No IP, no user agent, no session. Not
 *    because they are unavailable — the request has all three — but because a
 *    row that carried any of them would make section 2 of the Privacy Policy
 *    false. EventPrivacyTest is the guard.
 *
 * The consequence, stated plainly so nobody later mistakes these numbers for
 * something they are not: client-reported counts are forgeable up to the
 * throttle. They are a signal about a funnel, never a figure to bill from.
