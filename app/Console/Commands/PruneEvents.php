/**
 * Deletes anonymous site event counts older than the published retention window.
 *
 * This command is what makes the retention period in section 2 of the Privacy
 * Policy true. That section is rendered from config('site.event_retention_days')
 * rather than restating a number, so the document and the code cannot drift —
 * but only this command turns the number into a fact.
 *
 * The rows identify nobody, so the argument for a bounded window is not privacy
 * law but honesty and volume: we published a period, and this table grows on
 * every generated code rather than on every sale.
 *
 * Modelled closely on PruneScans, including the chunked deletes: `site_events`
 * is written on the instant-generator request path, and an unbounded DELETE
 * would hold locks while the homepage queues up behind it.
