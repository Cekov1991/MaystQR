/**
 * Deletes uploaded centre logos that no QR code refers to.
 *
 * The public create form uploads the logo before the record exists. A guest who
 * chooses a logo and then abandons the registration leaves the file behind with
 * nothing pointing at it, and nothing else ever collects it: the model's
 * `deleting` hook only reaches logos a saved record owns.
 *
 * Unreferenced is therefore not the same as abandoned. Every logo belonging to a
 * registration still in flight is also unreferenced, which is what the grace
 * period in `site.orphan_logo_grace_hours` protects — without it this command
 * would delete the upload while the guest is still reading their verification
 * email.
