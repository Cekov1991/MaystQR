        <h2>What you pay</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>{{ \App\Support\SubscriptionPrice::formatted() }} per year.</strong>
            Billed once a year and renewing automatically until you cancel. Prices are in
            {{ \App\Support\SubscriptionPrice::currency() }}.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Tax is included.</strong> AgentaOS is the merchant of record for every
            purchase and handles VAT or sales tax for your country, so the price above is the
            total you pay — nothing is added at checkout. Your invoice and receipt come from
            AgentaOS, and the charge appears on your statement under their name.
        </p>

        <h2>The free trial</h2>
        <p>
            Every new account starts with
            <strong>{{ config('subscription.trial_days') }} days of full access</strong>, and
            we ask for no payment details to begin it. Nothing is charged when the trial ends;
            if you do not subscribe, your dynamic codes simply stop resolving and everything
            stays in your account waiting for you.
        </p>

        <h2>Cancelling and refunds</h2>
        <p>
            Cancel at any time from the Subscription page in your account. Cancelling stops
            the next renewal, and you keep full access until the end of the period you have
            already paid for.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you subscribe and change your mind, you have 14 days to ask for a full refund.
            The details are in our <a href="{{ url('/refund-policy') }}">Refund Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>What happens if I stop paying?</h2>
        <p>
            Your <strong>static codes are unaffected</strong> — they encode their destination
            directly, so they never depend on us and keep working permanently. Your dynamic
            codes stop redirecting and anyone scanning them sees a notice that the code is not
            active. Your codes, their destinations and your analytics are all retained, and
            they resume working the moment you subscribe again.
        </p>
