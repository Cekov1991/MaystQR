        The offer, opened only once a download has actually started — see the
        script below. Absent for anyone signed in: they have an account and the
        pitch would be for something they already have.

        A real <dialog> rather than a styled div. showModal() brings the focus
        trap, Escape-to-close, inerting of the page behind it and restoration of
        focus on close — all of which this needs to be usable by keyboard and a
        screen reader, and all of which is easy to hand-roll subtly wrong.

        This began life as an inline panel below the result. It was invisible in
        practice: on a phone the result panel is tall enough to push it off
        screen entirely, and on a desktop a quiet white card below the fold went
        unnoticed too. A modal is the only version of this that is actually seen.
