# MaystQR

A QR code generator where signed-up users manage a personal library of QR codes. Static codes are free forever; dynamic codes — the ones whose destination can be changed after printing — require a paid **Subscription** once the 7-day **Trial** ends.

## Language

### QR codes

**Static QR Code**:
A QR code whose image encodes the destination content directly, so scanning never touches MaystQR's servers.
_Avoid_: permanent QR, free QR

**Dynamic QR Code**:
A QR code whose image encodes a MaystQR short URL (`/q/{shortUrl}`), so every scan is resolved — and counted — by MaystQR before redirecting.
_Avoid_: trackable QR, editable QR (both are consequences, not the definition)

**Short URL**:
The 8-character public identifier in a Dynamic QR Code's encoded URL, permanent for the life of the code because the printed image cannot be reissued.
_Avoid_: slug, code, token

**Scan**:
One resolution of a Dynamic QR Code through `/q/{shortUrl}`, logged with device, browser, and geolocation. Static QR Codes produce no Scans by construction.

### People

**Owner**:
The User who created a QR Code and whose billing state decides whether it resolves.

**Scanner**:
Whoever points a phone at a QR Code — almost always a stranger with no MaystQR account, and never assumed to be the Owner.
_Avoid_: user (ambiguous: a Scanner cannot pay the Owner's Subscription)

### Billing

**Trial**:
The 7-day free period that begins when a User registers, during which their Dynamic QR Codes resolve normally. Account-level and card-free — MaystQR grants it, the payment provider knows nothing about it.
_Avoid_: free plan, freemium (the Trial ends; static codes stay free independently)

**Subscription**:
A User's yearly paid commitment that keeps their Dynamic QR Codes resolving, created at AgentaOS when the User pays the subscription Payment Link.
_Avoid_: plan, membership, package

**Payment Link**:
The reusable AgentaOS product (`type: subscription`, `billingInterval: year`) that a User pays to start a Subscription. One link exists for the whole product, not one per User.
_Avoid_: checkout URL (that is what a Checkout produces)

**Checkout**:
One AgentaOS session created from the Payment Link for one specific User, carrying that User's identity in `metadata` so the resulting payment can be attributed.
_Avoid_: order, session (ambiguous with Laravel's HTTP session)

**Entitlement**:
A User's currently-held right to have their Dynamic QR Codes resolve, held locally as a date MaystQR owns rather than a live question asked of AgentaOS. Granted by the Trial, extended by a Subscription, and outlived by a 7-day grace after the paid period ends.
_Avoid_: access, permission (those mean authorization, not billing state)

**Quota**:
The ceiling on how many QR Codes of each kind a User may create — 5 Dynamic, 50 Static by default. It gates creation only, and never stops an existing code from resolving.
_Avoid_: limit (unqualified), plan features

### Account states

**Trialing**:
Within the 7 days after registration. Dynamic QR Codes resolve; no card has been given.

**Subscribed**:
Holding an Entitlement paid for through AgentaOS. Dynamic QR Codes resolve.

**Lapsed**:
The Trial ended and no Subscription covers today. Dynamic QR Codes stop resolving; Static QR Codes, the library, and past Scan analytics stay fully available.
_Avoid_: expired (that word belonged to the retired per-code model), suspended, cancelled (cancelled is an AgentaOS Subscription status, not an account state)

## Relationships

- A **User** has at most one **Subscription** and exactly one **Trial**
- A **User** owns many **QR Codes**, each either **Static** or **Dynamic**, bounded by their **Quota**
- A **Dynamic QR Code** has many **Scans**; a **Static QR Code** has none
- A **Checkout** belongs to one **User** and is created from the single product-wide **Payment Link**
- An **Entitlement** belongs to a **User**, never to a **QR Code**

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "A user's trial ended yesterday and they never paid. What happens when someone scans one of their codes?"
> **Domain expert:** "Depends which kind. Their **Static QR Codes** keep working forever — the phone reads the destination straight off the image, we're not even in the loop. Their **Dynamic QR Codes** hit `/q/{shortUrl}`, we see the **Owner** has no **Entitlement** covering today, and the **Scanner** gets a page saying the code is inactive."
> **Dev:** "Does the scanner get told to pay?"
> **Domain expert:** "No — the **Scanner** is a stranger, they can't pay someone else's **Subscription**. They see a neutral page. The **Owner** gets the reactivate prompt, by email and in the panel."
> **Dev:** "So the trial is per code or per account?"
> **Domain expert:** "Per account. One **Trial** per **User**, seven days from registration. It doesn't matter when each code was made."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "expires" was overloaded — the `qr_codes.expires_at` column implemented a **per-code** 7-day trial extendable by buying a `QrCodePackage`. Resolved: expiry is now **account-level** only; a Dynamic QR Code's scannability follows its **Owner**'s **Entitlement**, and the per-code package product is retired.
- "subscription" was used for the abandoned PayPal scaffolding (`App\Models\Subscription`, `PayPalService::createSubscription()`, which actually created a one-time order). Resolved: **Subscription** means the AgentaOS yearly recurring commitment; the PayPal code is deleted.
- "user" was used for both the account holder and the person scanning. Resolved: **Owner** holds the account and pays; **Scanner** holds the phone and pays nothing.
