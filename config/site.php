    | Who is legally behind the service: the contracting party in the Terms and

    |
    | This must match the account holder at AgentaOS. They are our merchant of
    | record, so the question their review answers is who they are selling on
    | behalf of — one identity here against another there is exactly the mismatch
    | that stalls the application.
    |
    | The service is operated by a registered company, so the name must be the
    | one in the central registry, including the legal form. Not the trading name:
    | "Easy QR Code" is the product and "Mayst Impact" the brand, but neither is
    | the contracting party.
    |
    | This was briefly set to an individual, on the plan of applying as one. The
    | company won on liability rather than tax — a QR redirect service is a
    | phishing vector by construction, and the entity is what keeps a victim's
    | claim away from a private person's assets.
    |
    | Was 'company' with a default of "Mayst Impact", unqualified. If
    | SITE_COMPANY_NAME or SITE_COMPANY_ADDRESS are still set in a deployed .env
    | they are ignored; delete them so they cannot mislead later.
